			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="serif">The Cryptarchy is a project about organizing information in a more considered and unique way. The subject for this site comes from lore books from the Destiny video game franchise. </p>
			<p class="serif">Lore entries have been present since the game’s inception in the form an official website, 3rd party website and in-game interface. However, most of these solutions have been unable to fully encapsulate the richness of these stories through the content’s presentation and organization. The goal of this site is to give each  entry the feeling and structure of a real lore book. This would make the content more intertwined with the in-game universe and make it more engaging to read.</p>
